> The universe has a beginning, but no end. — Infinity.

> Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction. — Finite.

> It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this.

> You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.
