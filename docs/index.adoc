== What is FG42

=== Goals
The ultimate goal of *HellHound* is to create a set of libraries for creating well orginized, simple, easy to test, easy to
to scale and distribute applications using Clojure and Clojurescipt around streams and data pipelines.

Another goal of this project is to create a tool which allows developers to focus on their business logic as much as possible
while *HellHound* takes care of different aspects of their distributed and scalable software in an opinionated way. We want
to achieve this using different component which provides these kind of tasks.
