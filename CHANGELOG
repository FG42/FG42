## [Unreleased]
### Added
	- `System` implementation (`core/fg42/system.el`)
	- New `extensions` implementation (`core/fg42/extensions.el`)
	- New approach to launching fg42
	- New `compiler` target to Makefile
	- New fbt package and moved `fbt` and `fg42-new` scripts to the `/bin` directory.
	- Created the `fpkg` module in `fbt` in order to separate the straight initialization from FG42 so we don't have to work with free dynamic var/functions.
	- Added `debug` support to `fbt` via `:d`
	- Added expr evaluation via `:e`
	- Added `system` support to `fbt`. We can build different systems with `fbt`. It's more like a generic build tool right now.
	- Added `fpkg` related fields to the system struct.
	- fpkg `init` command bootstraps straight.
	- Added `clean` command to fbt

### Changed
	- Changed the main package path to `/core`
	- Changed the extensions path to `/extensions`
	- We don't load `fg42-config.el` anymore
	- We don't load anything from `/lib` anymore
